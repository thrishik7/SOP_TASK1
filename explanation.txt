According to Darwinian principle species evolve over time ,thus that chicken had ancestors that were not chickens , like humans whose ansestors are bonobos and chimpanzees.
chickens are domesticated descendants of red junglefowl and probably arose little more than eight thousand year ago.but the first amniote egg(hard-shelled egg) that could be laid on land,appeared around 312 million years ago.
thus, egg came first.
