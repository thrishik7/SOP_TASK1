Egg

Answer: Since the beginning of time, animals have been laying eggs in water, relying on it for moisture such that the eggs didn't dry out.
However, at some point, a different sort of egg evolved which had multiple membranes: chorion, amnion and allantois, and were in fact, hard to the touch. 
These eggs were called amiotic eggs. As these eggs weren't very good fossils, scientiests weren't provided with enough evidence about their origin.
Amniotic eggs are predicted to have originated 370 million years ago. 

The chicken was a result of a genetic mutation taking place in a zygote produced by two proto-chickens. Somewhere along the lines of reproduction between this
species, mutations occured which resulted in the first chicken. The eggs laid by these species of true chicken were thus called chicken eggs.

Hence, to support my answer, amniotic eggs, similar to those that are chicken eggs, came first. However, chicken eggs came only after the species chicken 
came into existence, which is the only plausible explaination 


"At the end of the day, the question is something of a false dichotomy. Eggs certainly came before chickens, but chicken eggs did not—you can’t have one without the other. "
