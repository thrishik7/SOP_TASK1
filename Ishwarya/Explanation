Eggs are found throughout the animal kingdom. Technically speaking, an egg is simply the membrane-bound vessel inside which an embryo can grow and develop until it can survive on its own.
The chicken was a result of a genetic mutation taking place in a zygote produced by two proto-chickens. Somewhere along the lines of reproduction between this
species, mutations occured which resulted in the first chicken. The eggs laid by these species of true chicken were thus called chicken eggs.
SO, eggs came first. But chicken eggs came only after chicken came into existence.
