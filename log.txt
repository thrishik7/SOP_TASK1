For an egg to be produced we require two gametes which fertilise to form an egg.
This only means that there should have been two mates to hav produced that egg.
We can clearly understand from Darwin's Theory that every organism came from a single cell and evolved.
Applying that theory, clearly chickens came into being and two sexually mature mates were required for an egg.
